## *Building an open source SD Toolkit for Pros and Enthusiasts*

Since the Stable Diffusion model was released, a group of individuals (beginning with @Lstein) have been working to bring together the best tools for generating high-quality images into a single, easy-to-use repo. In September 2022, the InvokeAI team officially formed to continue building this set of tools, and support the growing community of pros, enthusiasts, and developers building on Invoke.

### üåç A community of Developers & Creators

The community sits at the center of what we do. The features we work on and the path ahead for the toolkit is directly informed by user and developer feedback, as well as ideas/research shared by others in the community.

We'd love to have you join us in building the future of this toolkit -

### **+!** Contributing to the ecosystem

We contribute to the tools and projects that help to build and run InvokeAI, while also maintaining InvokeAI as our own open source project. Take a look at our current projects below, and let us know how we can improve it (or better yet, chip in!):
