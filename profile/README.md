Originally a fork by Dr. Lincoln Stein (@lstein) of the original Stable Diffusion CompVis repo, Invoke AI has evolved into a creative AI platform redefining how open sourced software and businesses get built.

Our team believes in the power of open source, and that the advent of AI requires a different approach to building technology. 

### üåç A community of Developers & Creators

The community sits at the center of what we do. The features we work on and the path ahead for the toolkit is directly informed by user and developer feedback, as well as ideas/research shared by others in the community.

We'd love to have you join us in building the future of this ecosystem -
